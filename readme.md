### slice_example
How to declare a slice and append elements to it.

### maps

## fmt_verbs
Uses some format verbs to display a number.
- Deciamal
- Binary
- Char
- Octal

- Decimal `%d`
- Binary `%b`
- Hex `%#X`
- Char `%q`

## for_and_module_op
Code example that implements a for to generate a counter and a conditional (_if_) to clasificate generated numbers in **odd** and **even** using a module operation `x % 2`.

## functions
### anon_function
A simple code that shows how to declare and execute a anonymous function.

### callback
Example of a function call that needs a callback function to do certain things.

### variadic_params
Example of a function that can recive a unlimited number of arguments and stores in a collection, it's called variadic function.

## inner_functions

## nested_loops
Example of nested loops, prints values of both vars.

## packages_and_imports

## switch_case_default
Example code using switch statements.

## switch_on_types
An example of how to implement a type based switch function.

## types
A program that defines twoo custom types using **struct**, one inside the other; both of them has a method with the same name that the code calls for each type, it also contains a function that receive a pointer to a custom type.

## variables
Example about the both ways to declare a variable.

## vars_scope
How does scopes works on _**Go**_:

### main
